Hello there ðŸ‘‹.

I do some iOS app development in my spare time, some of which ends up on this github account. You can find my ocassional (usualy also iOS app dev related) blogging at [iosapp.dev](https://iosapp.dev) and other random thoughts or photos at [mbehan.com](http://mbehan.com) (the sort of stuff I would have tweeted back when I had a twitter account).

If you want to talk to me about worky work you can find me at [Marino Software](http://www.marinosoftware.com).
