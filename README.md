Hello there ðŸ‘‹.

This github account is primarily for my occasional spare time iOS app development. You can find my similarly occasional blogging on the topic at [iosapp.dev](https://iosapp.dev) and other less developery thoughts or photos at [mbehan.com](http://mbehan.com)

If you want to get in touch with me you could try michael@iosapp.dev
