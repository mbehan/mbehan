Hello there ðŸ‘‹.

I do some iOS app development in my spare time, some of which ends up being public on this github account. You can find my occasional (usually also iOS app dev related) blogging at [iosapp.dev](https://iosapp.dev) and other less developery thoughts or photos at [mbehan.com](http://mbehan.com) (the sort of stuff I would have tweeted back when I had a twitter account.)

If you want to get in touch you can try michael@iosapp.dev or if you want to talk to me about worky work you can find me at [Marino Software](http://www.marinosoftware.com).
